# SUMMARY
- A game that uses neural networks to predict the next number in a sequence
- Custom created Neural Network without using any libraries. Just simple arrays and vector-calculus with all the fun math included.  






This game asks the user to enter either "0" or "1" 10 times and the machine will output what it thinks the user would have entered next.

The core of the backpropagation method was leared from Milo Spencer's "How to build a simple neural network in 9 lines of Python code"
